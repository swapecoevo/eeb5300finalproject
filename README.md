#Step 1: File Organization and Quality Control
Files belong to Elizabeth Jockusch and Cera Fisher. To begin, we decided to focus on Pronotum, Wing2, Wing3 and Abdomen files for both the fourth and fifth instar. The Wing2 and Wing3 are understood to be involved in Pronotum development, meanwhile the Abdomen would serve as our outgroup for reference. Next, we ran FastQC and MultiQC on all of the files, which produced a large output. Overall, the quality was good and we had low adapter content. Two files, N10 and N11, were poor in quality but ultimately kept in our analysis.
